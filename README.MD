# 🖥️ React Three Fiber Portfolio-SDE | Data Engineer)

This project is a **3D portfolio website** built using [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber). It features a stylized 3D monitor playing a video, glowing floating text, and a smooth interactive experience — all rendered with WebGL in real-time.
I am showing my work experience,projects.

Special thanks to community letting me borrow the free 3D assets for this personal showcase.
The monitor,screen and desk was created by me using blender.
